# Beardley's Diablo Orbs Vanilla

Hey there,
this is a backported Diablo like UI for World of Warcraft 1.12.1 (Vanilla)

Preview: https://i.imgur.com/ZLLwDik.jpg

Hints:
 - Missing an actionbar? Enable all actionbars in the Interface Settings (ESC -> Interface)
 
 - UI too Big/Small? Change the scaling open "BeardleysDiabloOrbsVanilla.lua" and change the first Variable "Scalefactor"

 - When the artwork is not attached to the orbs just enable UI-Scaling in Graphics Options and set it to 
 
 - Still miss an actionbar or button?  Just tell me which it was and I will add it ðŸ™‚
